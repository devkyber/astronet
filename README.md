# AstroNet colab_ver3: Exoplanet Detection with Deep Learning

A modern PyTorch implementation of AstroNet for exoplanet detection in Kepler light curves, optimized for Google Colab environments.

## Abstract testjgodjpsaoing

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of AstroNet, a deep convolutional neural network originally developed by Google Research for detecting exoplanet transits in Kepler light curves. The colab_ver3 implementation offers enhanced features for research and practical exoplanet discovery applications, building upon the original TensorFlow work by Shallue & Vanderburg (2018) and subsequent PyTorch translation by the NASA Frontier Development Lab team.

## Background

### Original Research

AstroNet was originally developed in TensorFlow by [Shallue & Vanderburg (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05044) for classifying exoplanet transits in Kepler light curves. The model uses a two-branch CNN architecture:

The model uses a two-branch CNN architecture:
- **Global Branch**: Processes full light curves (2001 time points) to capture long-term stellar behavior
- **Local Branch**: Analyzes zoomed-in transit views (201 time points) to detect transit shapes  
- **Fusion**: Combines features from both branches for final classification

**Original TensorFlow Implementation**: [Google Research exoplanet-ml repository](https://github.com/google-research/exoplanet-ml)

### NASA FDL Contribution

In 2018, [NASA's Frontier Development Lab](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/) (FDL) formed a team of scientists and machine learning experts to enhance AstroNet with scientific domain knowledge. The team translated the model from TensorFlow to PyTorch and added improvements for practical exoplanet discovery.

## Architecture

### Model Structure

```
Input: Light Curve Data
├── Global View (2001 points) → Global Branch → Features
├── Local View (201 points)   → Local Branch  → Features
└── Fusion Layer → Classification → Exoplanet Probability
```

### Implementation Structure

See [colab_ver3_structure_chart.md](colab_ver3_structure_chart.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Features

### Core Implementation
- **Google Colab Integration**: Automated data extraction from Google Drive
- **Data Organization**: Automatic file organization into train/val/test splits
- **Model Training**: 50 epochs, batch size 64, 12 workers for Colab
- **Evaluation**: Validation and test set metrics with visualizations

### Scientific Applications
- **Model Training**: Train AstroNet on Kepler light curves
- **Performance Evaluation**: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and average precision
- **Visualization**: Generate training curves and evaluation plots
- **Results Export**: Save model weights and CSV files with predictions

## Installation

### Google Colab (Recommended)

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload Kepler data files to Google Drive in the `astronet_data` folder
3. Run the training pipeline

## Data Requirements

Each sample requires three files:
- `*_global.npy`: Full light curve (2001 time points)
- `*_local.npy`: Zoomed-in transit view (201 time points)  
- `*_info.npy`: Metadata including labels

Download Kepler data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N6bA2rahvV5kcOGmJnTA5gl_Thno7hTh/view?usp=sharing) and organize into `train/`, `val/`, `test/` folders.


### Key Improvements over Original

- **Modular Architecture**: 13 functions vs 3 monolithic functions
- **Google Colab Integration**: Automated data handling vs manual command-line
- **Enhanced Visualization**: 8+ plots vs 4 basic plots
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: 10+ metrics vs 3 basic metrics
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallbacks vs minimal validation
- **Documentation**: 150+ lines of docstrings vs basic comments

## Configuration

### Default Settings

```python
